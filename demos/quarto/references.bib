	abstract = {Shape correspondence is an important and challenging problem in geometry processing. Generalized map representations, such as functional maps, have been recently suggested as an approach for handling difÔ¨Åcult mapping problems, such as partial matching and matching shapes with high genus, within a generic framework. While this idea was shown to be useful in various scenarios, such maps only provide low frequency information on the correspondence. In many applications, such as texture transfer and shape interpolation, a high quality pointwise map that can transport high frequency data between the shapes is required. We name this problem map deblurring and propose a robust method, based on a smoothness assumption, for its solution. Our approach is suitable for non-isometric shapes, is robust to mesh tessellation and accurately recovers vertex-to-point, or precise, maps. Using the same framework we can also handle map denoising, namely improvement of given pointwise maps from various sources. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art for both deblurring and denoising of maps on benchmarks of non-isometric shapes, and show an application to high quality intrinsic symmetry computation.},
